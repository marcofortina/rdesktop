# IMPORTANT: rdesktop is no longer maintained

Please, beware that this project is no longer maintained and hadn't received
a patch in many years. There are reported security vulnerabilities, yet those
haven't been reviewed.

Use with caution and use it at your own risk.

# rdesktop - A Remote Desktop Protocol client

rdesktop is an open source client for Microsoft's RDP protocol. It is
known to work with Windows versions ranging from NT 4 Terminal Server
to Windows 2012 R2 RDS. rdesktop currently has implemented the RDP version 4
and 5 protocols.


## Installation

rdesktop uses a GNU-style build procedure.  Typically all that is necessary
to install rdesktop is the following:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

The default is to install under `/usr/local`.  This can be changed by adding
`--prefix=<directory>` to the configure line.

The smart-card support module uses PCSC-lite. You should use PCSC-lite 1.2.9 or
later. To enable smart-card support in the rdesktop add `--enable-smartcard` to
the configure line.


## Build dependencies

When building from source, rdesktop requires a C compiler, GNU make, X11
headers and libraries, pkg-config, GMP, GnuTLS, Nettle, hogweed, libtasn1 and
libXcursor.

When building from a git checkout instead of a release tarball, `autoconf` and
`automake` are also required because `./bootstrap` must generate the configure
script and Makefile templates.

Optional features need additional dependencies:

- smart-card support: PCSC-lite headers and library;
- CredSSP support: GSSAPI/Kerberos headers and library;
- sound support: one or more supported audio backends such as ALSA, PulseAudio,
  libao or OSS, plus libsamplerate when available.

On Debian and Ubuntu, a typical development setup is:

	% sudo apt-get install autoconf automake gcc make pkg-config \
		libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libgmp-dev \
		libgnutls28-dev nettle-dev libtasn1-6-dev

Add optional packages when enabling those features, for example:

	% sudo apt-get install libpcsclite-dev libkrb5-dev libasound2-dev \
		libpulse-dev libao-dev libsamplerate0-dev


## Note for users building from source

If you have retrieved a snapshot of the rdesktop source, you will first
need to run `./bootstrap` in order to generate the build infrastructure.
This is not necessary for release versions of rdesktop.


## Usage

Connect to an RDP server with:

	% rdesktop server

where `server` is the name of the Terminal Services machine. By default,
rdesktop connects to the standard RDP TCP port 3389; use `server:port` to
connect to a non-standard port. If you receive
"Connection refused", this probably means that the server does not have
Terminal Services enabled, or there is a firewall blocking access.

You can also specify a number of options on the command line.  These are listed
in the rdesktop manual page (run `man rdesktop`).

rdesktop can also read a Microsoft `.rdp` file when the file path is used
instead of `server[:port]`:

	% rdesktop connection.rdp

The parser applies common settings such as `full address`, `server port`,
`username`, `domain`, desktop size, colour depth, startup shell, working
directory, keyboard layout and clipboard redirection. Explicit command-line
options override matching settings read from the file.



## Documentation

Additional documentation is available in the `doc/` directory. In particular,
`doc/keymapping.txt` describes the keyboard mapping file format and
`doc/keymap-creation.txt` provides a practical checklist for creating or
updating keymaps.


## Troubleshooting

### `Autoselecting keyboard map ... from locale`

This line is informational, not a connection failure. It only means rdesktop
selected a keyboard map from your current locale. If the session does not open,
check the next error line for the real failure, such as an unreachable host, a
closed TCP port, a certificate prompt, or an X11 display problem.

To choose a keyboard layout explicitly, use `-k`, for example:

	% rdesktop -k ja server

### Certificate trust prompt

When a server certificate is not trusted by the system trust store, rdesktop asks:

	Do you trust this certificate (yes/no)?

Type `yes` to add a host-specific exception, or `no` to abort the connection.
Accepted exceptions are stored under the per-user rdesktop certificate store in
`~/.local/share/rdesktop/certs/known_certs`. There is no single key shortcut for
this prompt.

For scripted launchers, run rdesktop interactively once as the same user and
accept the certificate before using the launcher. rdesktop intentionally does not
provide a command-line option to blindly accept unknown certificates.

### `failed to open X11 display`

rdesktop is an X11 client. If startup fails with:

	UI(error): ui_init(), failed to open X11 display:

then rdesktop could not connect to an X server. Start it from a graphical X11
session, make sure the `DISPLAY` environment variable is set, and avoid running
it from a plain TTY or from `root` without X11 access. When using SSH, enable X11
forwarding or run rdesktop on the machine that owns the graphical session.
